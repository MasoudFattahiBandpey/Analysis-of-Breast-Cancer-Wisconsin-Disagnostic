## Introduction

Breast cancer remains a significant health issue globally. Accurate and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to use statistical techniques to analyze cell nuclei characteristics from breast tumor images to understand their impact on diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset, which includes various features such as:

- **Radius**
- **Texture**
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**

These features are computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. Each entry also includes an ID and a diagnosis label (malignant or benign).

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values and normalizing the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Analyzing correlations, covariances, and feature importance.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to predict the likelihood of a tumor being malignant or benign.

## Results

Key findings of this analysis include:

- Identification of important features contributing to the diagnosis.
- Insights into correlations between different characteristics of cell nuclei.
- Potential predictive factors that can assist in improving diagnostic accuracy.

## Conclusions

The insights from this project can help healthcare professionals better understand the factors influencing breast cancer diagnoses, ultimately aiding in more accurate and earlier detection.
